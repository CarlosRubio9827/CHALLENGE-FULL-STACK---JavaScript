# CHALLENGE FULL STACK - JavaScript

Web application for personal budget management.


## Installation

First of all, clone this repository with the command 
```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/CarlosRubio9827/CHALLENGE-FULL-STACK---JavaScript
```
Don't forget to go to the root of the cloned project.

```bash 
    cd 'CHALLENGE-FULL-STACK---JavaScript'
```

Once installed in your local environment, you must install the dependencies with the next command.

```bash
    npm i
```

The script for creating the database is located in the ``db.sql`` file, in the root directory. For a better understanding of the design of the tables, the entity relationship model is attached, which is also in the root folder and is called ``Mer.png``.
    
## Run locally

Once the database has been configured, and the manager is running, the application can be used locally with the command:

```bash
  npm run devStart
```
